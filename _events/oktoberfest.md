Highly anticipated and open to the public, the Oktoberfest is always a continued highlight of our annual festivities. An attractive event for those seeking an enjoyable night of food, drinks and live music, the Oktoberfest has become a  well known, keystone event in the Foundationâ€™s schedule. <!--more--> A great opportunity to connect face to face with our members, the board enjoys using this event to create a strong sense of identity within the community and revisit valued friendship with our members. A fantastic call to action, the Oktoberfest is an ideal venue to invite our community and surrounding areas to participate in a membership with the college in an effort to further the goals of our campus, proving to be one of the most successful calendar events hosted by the Foundation. As a major contributor to the revenue the Foundation is able to raise, the event generates a large portion of the scholarship funds used to give to our gifted students at our MCC campus.
