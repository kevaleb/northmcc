<!--
In union with our donorâ€™s event, the Foundation also had a great time inviting our members to an equally exciting Members Only event to show our appreciation for their consistent efforts within the college. <!--more--*> Open to the public to become a member in order to attend the event, it was useful to both generate memberships as well as show our appreciation for those already involved.  Enjoyed outdoors over food and drink, it provided an opportunity for the Foundation to connect with the community to show our appreciation.-->
